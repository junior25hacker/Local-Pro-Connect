Agile SDLC For Local Pro
Connect
🚀 1. Planning & Inception (Conceptualization & Vision)
This phase establishes the project's foundation and overall direction.
• Define the Vision: Clearly articulate the app's purpose: "To be the most
trusted platform for connecting users with verified, highly-rated local
service providers."
• Identify Core Features (Product Backlog Initial Draft):
• User Side: Search, Filtering, Service Provider Profiles, Ratings &
Reviews, Booking/Contact.
• Provider Side: Profile Creation, Service Listing, Review
Management.
• Admin Side: User/Provider Verification, Content Moderation.
• Determine Stakeholders: Users, Service Providers, App
Owners/Investors, Development Team.
• Establish the Team & Tools: Set up the development team (roles:
Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers) and select tools (e.g.,
Jira/Trello for task management, Git for version control).
• Define "Done": Establish the criteria for when a feature/task is complete
and acceptable.

💡 2. Iterative Development & Sprints (Implementation)
This is the core execution phase, broken down into short, time-boxed Sprints
(typically 2-4 weeks). Each Sprint delivers a potentially shippable increment of
the product.

A. Requirements Gathering & Prioritization (Product Backlog
Refinement)
• The Product Owner creates detailed requirements (User Stories) for all
features, prioritizing them based on business value and user needs.
• Example User Story: "As a Homeowner, I want to be able to search
for a Plumber based on location and rating so I can quickly find a
trusted professional near me."
• The team estimates the effort for each User Story.
B. Sprint Planning
• At the start of each Sprint, the team selects the highest priority User
Stories from the Product Backlog that they believe they can complete
(the Sprint Backlog).
• The goal for the Sprint (Sprint Goal) is defined.
C. Execution (Development)
• Developers write, test, and integrate code for the selected User Stories.
• Day 1 (Sprint 1): Focus on the minimum viable core functionality
(e.g., User registration and a basic search function).
• Day 2 (Sprint 2): Introduce Provider Profile creation and a simple
Rating system.
• Day N (Subsequent Sprints): Add more complex features like
robust filtering, real-time communication, admin verification
workflows, and payment integration.
• Daily Stand-ups (Scrum): The team meets daily for 15 minutes to
synchronize efforts, discuss progress (What I did yesterday, What I will
do today), and identify roadblocks.

🧪 3. Testing & Review (Verification & Validation)
Testing is continuous and happens within each Sprint.
• Unit Testing & Integration Testing: Performed by developers as code is
written.

• Sprint Review: At the end of the Sprint, the team demonstrates the
completed increment (working features) to stakeholders. Stakeholders
provide feedback.
• User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Users or the Product Owner test the
features against the User Stories to ensure they meet the defined
requirements.

🔄 4. Deployment (Release & Feedback)
Once an increment is deemed stable and valuable, it can be released. In Agile,
deployment can occur after every few Sprints or when a significant milestone
(e.g., a Beta version) is reached.
• Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Automated
processes ensure the latest code is built and can be deployed quickly and
reliably.
• Release to Beta/Pilot Users: Initial launch to a small group for realworld feedback on the core features.

👂 5. Retrospective & Adaptation (Continuous Improvement)
This phase ensures the process itself improves.
• Sprint Retrospective: After the Sprint Review, the development team
meets internally to discuss:
• What went well?
• What could be improved?
• What will we commit to changing in the next Sprint?
• Product Backlog Adjustment: Based on customer feedback from the
Sprint Review and market changes, the Product Backlog is reprioritized
and refined for the next set of Sprints. The cycle then repeats, ensuring
the app continuously evolves and delivers maximum value.

SUMMARY
🛠️Building "Local Pro Connect": The Simple Agile Way
Phase 1: Planning and Dreaming 💭
(What do we want to build?)
1. Define the Big Idea: We decide exactly what the app is for (connecting
users to trusted plumbers, tutors, etc.) and what makes it special (reliable
ratings and verified pros).
2. Make a Wish List: We write down every feature we might want—this is
called the Product Backlog. (e.g., Search, Profiles, Reviews, Login.)
3. Choose the First Steps: We pick the most important, basic things we
need to get started (like creating a simple profile and a way to log in).

Phase 2: Building in Small Chunks (Sprints) 🧱
(The actual work, done in short bursts.)
We work in cycles called Sprints, which are usually 2 or 3 weeks long.
A. Start of the Cycle (Sprint Planning)
• The team looks at the Wish List and says, "Okay, this week, we will
definitely build user login and the basic search button."
• This becomes our goal for the next two weeks.
B. The Daily Grind (Execution)
• Daily Check-in: Every morning, the team has a quick, 15-minute
meeting (the Daily Stand-up). Everyone answers three simple questions:
1. What did I finish yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. Is anything stopping me?

• The developers build the features and test them constantly to make sure
they work right away.

Phase 3: Showing and Fixing (Review and Repeat) 👀
(Making sure we built the right thing and improving the process.)
A. Show the Work (Sprint Review)
• At the end of the two weeks, the team shows the new, working features
(like the new login screen and the search button) to the
owner/stakeholders.
• The owner uses it and gives immediate feedback: "I like the login, but
the search button needs to be bigger."
B. Improve the Process (Retrospective)
• The development team meets privately to discuss how they worked: "We
spent too much time on the search button. Next time, let's coordinate
better."
• They agree on one change to make the next cycle better.
C. Repeat!
• Based on the owner's feedback and the team's improvement plan, the team
goes back to the Wish List, picks the next most important features (maybe
creating a full provider profile), and starts a brand new Sprint.

That's an excellent approach! With a team of six and a 2-week deadline for
Sprint 1, clear planning and assignment of tasks are essential.
Given your team's skill set (HTML/CSS, Python, Java), we will choose a
Python-centric full-stack architecture for speed and simplicity.
🏃 Sprint 1: Detailed Breakdown (2 Weeks)
🎯 Sprint 1 Goal
Launch the absolute barebones system where users and providers can
register/log in, providers can input their specific location data (for hyper-local
search in Sprint 2), and a basic list of providers is displayed.

💻 Technology Stack Choices
To maximize your team's current language skills and hit the 7-week deadline,
here is the suggested stack:
1. Backend/API (Server Logic): Python using the Django or Flask
framework. (We'll use Django for its "batteries included" features like the
built-in Admin panel, which is required for Sprint 1.)
2. Frontend (Website/Web App): HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
(rendered by Django templates).

3. Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite (SQLite is faster for local
development, switch to PostgreSQL for production).
• Recommendation: For the 7-week MVP, you must cut the native
mobile app and focus entirely on building a high-quality, mobileresponsive website (using HTML/CSS/Django). Building a native
app is too complex and time-consuming for a 7-week deadline. We
will treat the website as the primary mobile web app.

🛠️Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
VS Code is absolutely sufficient and highly recommended for your entire stack:
• Python/Django: Excellent extensions for debugging, linting, and virtual
environments.
• HTML/CSS: Robust support for syntax highlighting and live previews.
• Database: Extensions to browse and manage your database directly
within the IDE.

💻 Technology Focus
• Backend: Python/Django (Focus on geospatial calculation logic
and API creation).
• Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (Focus on presenting the distance and
rating data).
• Key Tool: A geocoding library (like Python's geopy or a service
like Google Maps API/OpenStreetMap) is needed to convert the
street addresses (from Sprint 1) into GPS coordinates ($latitude$
and $longitude$).
